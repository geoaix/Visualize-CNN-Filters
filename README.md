# Visualize-CNN-Filters
Visualizing the CNN Layer outputs and filters in Keras

#### In this notebook, we'll first visualize the output of each layers and visualize weights of layers. Later in the notebook, we'll see how the change in the properties of the input image activate the individual filters in model.

##### _Step 1: Visualize the weights in each layer_
##### _Step 2: Visualize the output of individual filters in a given layer based on given input_
##### _Step 3: Visualize the maximization of weights for optimized input value_
